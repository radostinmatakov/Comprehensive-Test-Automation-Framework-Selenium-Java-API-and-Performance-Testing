# WeAre - Social Network Web Application

## Project Overview

"WeAre" is a Social Network web application designed to facilitate connections between users. It enables users to create, comment on, and like posts, as well as view a dynamic feed of the newest and most relevant posts from their connections.

This repository is part of a Telerik Academy project and provides an overview of the WeAre platform alongside several testing frameworks developed from scratch to ensure the quality and stability of the application.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate comprehensive testing frameworks and methodologies used to verify that the "WeAre" platform meets user requirements. These frameworks are designed for educational purposes and are non-executable, serving as a reference for learning and exploring different testing strategies.

The repository includes frameworks for:

- UI Automation Testing with Selenium
- API Testing using Postman
- API Testing using REST Assured
- Performance Testing

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Planning

- Prepare a detailed plan with estimates for each activity involved in the testing process.

### 2. Test Plan

- Create a test plan that outlines all activities required to verify the quality of the product. Follow templates and guides covered in the materials from the lectures.

### 3. Test Cases

- Develop high-level test cases that ensure the required quality level and cover customer requirements. Utilize the management tool JIRA for test case management.

### 4. Execution

#### 4.1 Manual Testing

- Conduct exploratory testing for the entire system, covering main functionalities and happy paths.
- Create a coverage report that indicates which test cases were executed and their results.

#### 4.2 Automation Testing

- Create automated test suites to cover at least the happy paths.
- Ensure detailed reports for each execution, providing information on the number of tests that pass/fail.

##### 4.2.1 UI Testing

- Utilize Selenium Web Driver for UI testing.

##### 4.2.2 API Testing

- Use REST Assured and Postman for API testing.

### 5. Reporting

- Generate reports that summarize the testing process, including results from manual and automated testing.

## Limitations

This repository is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is not executable and does not include runnable software or dependencies. Its purpose is to showcase the frameworks and methodologies developed during the Telerik Academy program.

## Key Features

- Built from Scratch: All frameworks were designed and implemented independently.
- Framework Variety: Covers UI automation, API testing, and performance testing.
- Comprehensive Structure: Includes planning, test case design, execution, and reporting processes.
- Educational Resource: Ideal for learning best practices in software testing.
